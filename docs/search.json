    "text": "What‚Äôs the point in a 3D printed model?\nIn a previous post, I described these models as a ‚Äútangible, miniature representations of the landscape that you can hold in your hands.‚Äù They‚Äôre definitely not going to change the world, but they might serve as a conversation starter as you gather around the table to talk about your environmental goals and aspirations.\n\n\n\nKoukourarata / Port Levy, Te Roto o Wairewa / Lake Forsyth, Te Waihora / Lake Ellesmere\n\n\nThese models offer a less abstract view of the landscape compared to a 2D paper map, focusing on elevation to reduce distractions. For visual thinkers, they can reveal connections and scales otherwise only visible from a helicopter.\nBy mapping the entire catchment, the model embodies the concept of Ki uta ki tai‚Äîa te ao MƒÅori perspective on integrated, indivisible land and river management, from the mountains to the sea.\nAnd they‚Äôre just damn cool."

This is a good size to hold in your hand or pass around.\nIf you want a bigger model, my printer can print up to ~300mm long in a single printed block. If you want larger than this, I can print multiple blocks which are either glued together or snap together with a dovetail joint. This is a bit more work, but it‚Äôs definitely possible.\nAnother option is to print multiple sub-catchments separately, the largest of which can take up the maximum size of the printer. If these sub-catchments are printed at a common scale, they should fit together like a jigsaw puzzle."

    "text": "What‚Äôs this going to cost me?\nOption 1: If you have access to a 3D printer through your local library, makerspace, or community, I can assist you with making an .STL file that you can print yourself.\nOption 2: Due to popular demand, I can also now offer to 3D print these models for you. Some people can‚Äôt access a 3D printer, want a multi-colour model, or simply want a ready-made product without the hassle. I‚Äôm happy to print one of my designs for your group (or multiple copies if your group‚Äôs members want their own).\nPricing is heavily discounted for catchment groups and mainly designed to cover my consumable costs. Commercial-grade 3D printers don‚Äôt come cheap, and I‚Äôve got other direct costs like filament, power, and maintenance. One of these models typically ties up my printer for 8-12 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nOtama\n\n\nI can provide an exact quote, which will depend on the size, complexity, etc. But for indicative pricing, expect in the $50-$100 range per model.\nOption 3: If you‚Äôre not a catchment group or simply want one for your personal use, discounted pricing doesn‚Äôt apply. However, I‚Äôd still love to make one for you! In fact, the more paying customers I have, the more non-profit groups I can support. Please get in touch and I can provide a quote based on the complexity of the design.\nI‚Äôm located in Christchurch and can post anywhere. Please allow 2-3 weeks lead time.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper Ruamahanga"

Here are the steps to consider:\n\nLocation: The catchment must be in New Zealand. Anywhere in New Zealand is fine, but very small catchments may require LiDAR data, which isn‚Äôt available everywhere.\nDefine your area of interest: This doesn‚Äôt have to be a hydrological catchment. It can be a square, circle, sub-catchment, FMU, or multiple catchments. Any contiguous boundary works.\nObtain a shapefile: It‚Äôs easiest if you can provide a GIS shapefile (.shp) of your area of interest. Otherwise if it‚Äôs a catchment, I can likely derive this for you.\nGet in touch: Fill out this Google form:\n\n\n\nLoading‚Ä¶"
