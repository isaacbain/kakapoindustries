    "text": "What‚Äôs the point in a 3D printed model?\nIn a previous post, I described these models as a ‚Äútangible, miniature representations of the landscape that you can hold in your hands.‚Äù They‚Äôre definitely not going to change the world, but they might serve as a conversation starter as you gather around the table to talk about your environmental goals and aspirations.\n\n\n\nKoukourarata / Port Levy, Te Roto o Wairewa / Lake Forsyth, Te Waihora / Lake Ellesmere\n\n\nThese models offer a less abstract view of the landscape compared to a 2D paper map, focusing on elevation to reduce distractions. For visual thinkers, they can reveal connections and scales otherwise only visible from a helicopter.\nBy mapping the entire catchment, the model embodies the concept of Ki uta ki tai‚Äîa te ao MƒÅori perspective on integrated, indivisible land and river management, from the mountains to the sea.\nAnd they‚Äôre just damn cool."

This is a good size to hold in your hand or pass around.\nIf you want a bigger model, my printer can print up to ~300mm long in a single printed block. If you want larger than this, I can print multiple blocks which are either glued together or snap together with a dovetail joint. This is a bit more work, but it‚Äôs definitely possible.\nAnother option is to print multiple sub-catchments separately, the largest of which can take up the maximum size of the printer. If these sub-catchments are printed at a common scale, they should fit together like a jigsaw puzzle."

Here are the steps to consider:\n\nLocation: The catchment must be in New Zealand. Anywhere in New Zealand is fine, but very small catchments may require LiDAR data, which isn‚Äôt available everywhere.\nDefine your area of interest: This doesn‚Äôt have to be a hydrological catchment. It can be a square, circle, sub-catchment, FMU, or multiple catchments. Any contiguous boundary works.\nObtain a shapefile: It‚Äôs easiest if you can provide a GIS shapefile (.shp) of your area of interest. Otherwise if it‚Äôs a catchment, I can likely derive this for you.\nGet in touch: Fill out this Google form:\n\n\n\nLoading‚Ä¶"
