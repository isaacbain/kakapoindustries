Kākāpō Industries (NZBN: [9429052266102](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/mynzbn/nzbndetails/9429052266102/?sw=kakapo%20industries)) was founded by [Isaac Bain](www.isaacbain.com) out of a passion for turning New Zealand’s landscapes into tangible works of art. Based in **Ōtautahi / Christchurch**, we specialise in crafting **physical cartographic models**, with a particular focus on **3D topographic elevation models** that faithfully represent the contours of our whenua.

Our work blends scientific precision with creative design, making our models ideal for:

-   Environmental education

-   Community and stakeholder engagement

-   Public exhibitions and striking visual displays

By combining Isaac’s background in environmental science and data visualisation with advanced 3D printing technology, we produce models that are both accurate and visually compelling.

We're inspired by the kākāpō—a rare, resilient, and uniquely Aotearoa species. Like our namesake, we believe in thoughtful innovation and strengthening the connection between people and the natural world.

Let us help you hold the land in your hands. 🌏
