Kākāpō Industries (NZBN: [9429052266102](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/mynzbn/nzbndetails/9429052266102/?sw=kakapo%20industries)) was founded by [Isaac Bain](www.isaacbain.com) through his passion for turning landscapes into tangible works of art. Based in Ōtautahi / Christchurch, New Zealand we specialise in creating physical cartographic models, with a focus on 3D topographic elevation models that bring the contours of earth to life.

Our models blend precision and creativity, making them perfect for environmental education, community engagement, and unique décor. By combining Isaac’s background in environmental science and data visualisation with advanced 3D printing technologies, we deliver products that are as accurate as they are stunning.

We’re inspired by the **kākāpō**, a native and endangered New Zealand parrot known for its resilience and unique charm. Like its namesake, Kākāpō Industries is dedicated to innovation and preserving the connection between people and the natural world.

Let us help you hold the land in your hands. 🌏
