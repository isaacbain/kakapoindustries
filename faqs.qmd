\
**What materials do you use for 3D printing?**

We use **plant-based PLA filament**, made from renewable biomass sources like cornstarch or sugarcane. It’s durable, eco-friendly, and supports **multi-colour printing**—ideal for highlighting specific landscape features such as rivers, land boundaries, or zones.

\
**What is the typical size of a 3D model?**

Every model is **custom-sized** to suit your requirements—from small desktop displays to **large-format, multi-part models**. We'll help you determine the best scale and dimensions during the consultation.

\
**How long does it take to create a model?**

Most models are completed within **2–4 weeks**, depending on complexity, data availability, and print size. We'll confirm your timeline as part of the initial project scoping.

\
**Can you customise the model features (e.g., points of interest, colours)?**

Absolutely. We can highlight **monitoring sites, catchments, land use zones, or infrastructure** using custom colour palettes or added markers. Just let us know what matters to your audience.

\
**How do you ensure sustainability?**

Sustainability is at the core of both our materials and our ethos.

-   We print locally in Aotearoa using bio-based PLA

-   Packaging uses recycled and paper-based materials—no bubble wrap

-   Shipping is done in recyclable or compostable courier bags
