\
**What materials do you use for 3D printing?**

We use plant-based PLA filament (made from renewable biomass sources such as cornstarch or sugarcane), which is eco-friendly and allows for multi-colour printing to highlight specific features of your model.

\
**What is the typical size of a 3D model?**

Our models are custom-sized to suit your needs, whether you want a smaller desktop display or a large-format model. We’ll discuss size options during the consultation.

\
**How long does it take to create a model?**

On average, it takes 2–4 weeks to complete a model, depending on its complexity and the size of the area. We’ll provide an estimated timeline during the consultation.

\
**Can you customise the model features (e.g., points of interest, colours)?**

Yes! We can use custom colour schemes, or highlight specific features like rivers, land boundaries, or monitoring sites.

\
**How do you ensure sustainability?**

Our models are printed right here in New Zealand, using bio-based PLA filaments. Similarly, we ship using either PLA or recycled plastic courier bags, and use paper-based packaging instead of bubble wrap.
