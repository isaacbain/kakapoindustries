## Custom 3D Terrain Models — Built Just for You

At **Kākāpō Industries**, we create **bespoke 3D printed topographic and bathymetric models** tailored to your exact area of interest. Whether it's a **freshwater catchment**, **property parcel**, **management unit**, or another defined boundary, we can bring it to life in three dimensions.

(We also occasionally stock a range of **ready-made models** in our [shop](#), available for immediate purchase.)

**1 - Consultation**

Share your area of interest—whether it’s a GPS location, a named catchment, or a custom boundary. We can also work from your shapefiles.

**2 - Data Sourcing**

We gather the best available national datasets, or use your supplied data, including elevation, rivers, landcover, roads, and more.

**3 - Model Design**

A 3D rendering is prepared and shared for your approval before printing. You’ll see exactly what your model will look like.

**4 - Delivery**

Your model is printed, packaged in plastic-free materials, and shipped anywhere in New Zealand.
