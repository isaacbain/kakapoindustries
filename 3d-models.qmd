## The Process

:::

1.  **Consultation**: We'll start off by getting you to share your area of interest and requirements with us. We can derive catchment boundaries for anywhere in the country, or you can provide your own shapefiles for custom areas.
2.  **Data Sourcing**: Using national datasets or your supplied data, we gather the necessary high-resolution GIS and LiDAR data. Which may include rivers, roads, vegetation and other landcover data.
3.  **Model Design**: Our team crafts a bespoke 3D model based on your specifications, and shares renderings for your approval before printing.
4.  **Delivery**: Your completed model is carefully packaged in sustainable materials and couriered anywhere in New Zealand.
