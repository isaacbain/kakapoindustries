*Have you found your way here because you're part of a catchment group and interested in a 3D-printed topographic model of your catchment? If so, you're in the right place.*\

## What's the point in a 3D printed model?

In a previous [post](https://isaacbain.com/posts/upper-ruamahanga/), I described these models as a "*tangible, miniature representations of the landscape that you can hold in your hands*." They're definitely not going to change the world, but they might serve as a conversation starter as you gather around the table to talk about your environmental goals and aspirations.

These models offer a less abstract view of the landscape compared to a 2D paper map, focusing on elevation to reduce distractions. For visual thinkers, they can reveal connections and scales otherwise only visible from a helicopter.

By mapping the entire catchment, the model embodies the concept of *Ki uta ki tai*—a te ao Māori perspective on integrated, indivisible land and river management, from the mountains to the sea.

And they're just damn cool.

## How big are they?

My standard sized model is around 200mm long. This is a good size to hold in your hand or pass around.

If you want a bigger model, my printer can print up to \~300mm long in a single printed block. If you want larger than this, I can print multiple blocks which are either glued together or snap together with a dovetail joint. This is a bit more work, but it's definitely possible.

Another option is to print multiple sub-catchments separately, the largest of which can take up the maximum size of the printer. If these sub-catchments are printed at a common scale, they should fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

## What's this going to cost me?

**Option 1:** If you have access to a 3D printer through your local library, makerspace, or community, I can assist you with making an .STL file that you can print yourself.

**Option 2:** Due to popular demand, I can also now offer to 3D print these models for you. Some people can't access a 3D printer, want a multi-colour model, or simply want a ready-made product without the hassle. I’m happy to print one of my designs for your group (or multiple copies if your group’s members want their own).

Pricing is heavily discounted for catchment groups and mainly designed to cover my consumable costs. Commercial-grade 3D printers don't come cheap, and I've got other direct costs like filament, power, and maintenance. One of these models typically ties up my printer for 8-12 hours.

I can provide an exact quote, which will depend on the size, complexity, etc. But for indicative pricing, expect in the \$50-\$100 range per model.

**Option 3:** If you're **not** a catchment group or simply want one for your personal use, discounted pricing doesn't apply. However, I’d still love to make one for you! In fact, the more paying customers I have, the more non-profit groups I can support. Please [get in touch](https://isaacbain.com/contact) and I can provide a quote based on the complexity of the design.

I'm located in Christchurch and can post anywhere. Please allow 2-3 weeks lead time.

## I Want Something Completely Custom—Can You Do That?

Probably! Get in touch and let's figure it out. Some requests I’ve already had include:

-   Larger prints comprised of multiple blocks
-   Commercial projects for businesses or councils
-   Personal requests for individuals
-   Preparing files for laser cutting or CNC routing
-   Sub-catchments that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle

## Okay, I want one. How does the process work?

Fantastic! I'm here to help make this a reality. Here are the steps to consider:

1.  **Location:** The catchment must be in New Zealand. Anywhere in New Zealand is fine, but very small catchments may require LiDAR data, which isn’t available everywhere.
2.  **Define your area of interest:** This doesn’t have to be a hydrological catchment. It can be a square, circle, sub-catchment, FMU, or multiple catchments. Any contiguous boundary works.
3.  **Obtain a shapefile:** It's easiest if you can provide a GIS shapefile (.shp) of your area of interest. Otherwise if it's a catchment, I can likely derive this for you.
