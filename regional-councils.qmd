At **Kākāpō Industries**, we understand the critical role regional councils play in fostering community engagement and promoting sustainable management of natural resources. Our custom **3D topographic and bathymetric models** provide an innovative, visually engaging way to communicate complex spatial data to diverse audiences and communities.

## Why 3D Models for community engagement?

Interactive maps and technical reports can be overwhelming for many stakeholders. A **physical 3D model** bridges this gap, offering a tangible representation of the landscape that is:  

- **Intuitive and Accessible**: Ideal for public meetings and consultations.  
- **Eye-catching**: Draws attention and fosters curiosity.  
- **Educational**: Helps communities understand key environmental challenges.  

## Applications for Regional Councils  

Our 3D models have been successfully used by regional councils for:

- **Catchment Management**: Visualising water flow, sedimentation zones, and flood-prone areas.  
- **Land Use Planning**: Illustrating proposed developments or conservation projects.  
- **Climate Change Adaptation**: Communicating the impacts of sea-level rise or flooding on local landscapes.  
- **Biodiversity Initiatives**: Highlighting critical habitats and restoration efforts, including riparian planting.  

## Why Work with Kākāpō Industries?  

We combine advanced GIS and LiDAR technology with multi-colour 3D printing to produce highly detailed and customisable models. Each model is tailored to your needs, whether it’s for:  

- **Public Consultations**: Simplify communication of technical data to the public.  
- **Educational Workshops**: Engage schools and community groups with hands-on learning tools.  
- **Permanent Displays**: Create durable, visually appealing centrepieces for council offices or visitor centres.

One of our specialities, especially for making larger models, is to print multiple sub-catchments or FMUs at the same scale so that they fit together like a natural jigsaw puzzle. This allows you to differentiate the various FMUs in your region, or take individual pieces to engage with particular communities. 


## Let’s Work Together  

Transform how you engage with your community. [Contact us](contact.qmd) today to discuss your next project and discover how our 3D models can empower your council’s outreach efforts. We're happy to work directly with your GIS team and can handle a vast array of file formats.
