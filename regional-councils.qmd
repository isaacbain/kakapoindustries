## 3D-Printed Terrain Models for Regional Councils

At **Kākāpō Industries**, we partner with regional councils across Aotearoa to create **highly detailed 3D printed models** that support community engagement, environmental planning, and long-term stewardship of natural resources.

These models offer an innovative, tactile way to **communicate spatial data**, helping your teams better connect with stakeholders, whānau, and the wider public.

## Why Use 3D Models for Engagement?

Conventional GIS maps and technical reports can be difficult for non-specialists to interpret. Physical 3D models create a bridge—transforming complex data into a format that is:

-   🧠 Intuitive – Easily understood by diverse audiences

-   👁️ Visual – Eye-catching and memorable in public spaces

-   📚 Educational – Ideal for workshops, hui, and exhibitions

They foster understanding of environmental challenges such as erosion, water quality, flood risks, and biodiversity loss—grounded in the actual terrain people live in.

## Applications for Regional Councils

Our models are being used by councils for:

-   **Catchment Management**: Showcasing sedimentation patterns, riparian areas, and hydrological flow.\
-   **Land Use Planning**: Illustrating proposed zoning, infrastructure, or conservation interventions.\
-   **Climate Change Adaptation**: Communicating the impacts of sea-level rise or flooding on local landscapes.\
-   **Biodiversity Initiatives**: Highlighting habitats, planting corridors, and ecological values.

## What Sets Us Apart

We combine high-resolution GIS and LiDAR data with multi-colour 3D printing to create models tailored to your region and objectives. Every model is:

🗺️ Customised to match your spatial units (e.g. FMUs, catchments, zones)

🧩 Printable in modular pieces for easy transport and targeted engagement

♻️ Made with eco-friendly PLA from renewable plant-based sources

🏢 Suitable for consultation events, classrooms, and permanent displays

## Freshwater management units

We specialise in producing multi-part terrain models, such as freshwater management units printed at the same scale. These can be pieced together like a jigsaw or taken individually to local workshops and community hui.

## Let’s Work Together

Whether you're preparing for a regional plan review, public consultation, or science communication initiative, our 3D models offer a powerful, people-friendly way to visualise place and process. [Contact us](contact.qmd) to discuss your project. We’re happy to liaise directly with your GIS team, and can work with a wide range of formats and projections.
